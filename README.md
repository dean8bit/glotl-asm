UPDATE:

Check out [Luna](https://github.com/plato4/luna), Luna is a programming puzzle game that takes the concept of this project to the next level. It replaces the naive switch-case operator execution with a lookup table that allows for greater control over the instruction set. This includes the implementation of esoteric single instruction instruction-sets (FLIPBIT, SUBLEQ, P1eq), as well as a simple 7 instruction coding language (LBL, SET, ADD, SUB, JEZ, JMP JLZ). Give it a try!
