A custom asm like language for future games

UPDATE:

Check out [Luna](https://github.com/plato4/luna), a programming puzzle game, which is the next iteration of this project. It avoids the naive switch-case to execute operators, instead it uses a lookup table allowing control over what instructions are in the instruction-set. For example, implementation of single instruction esoteric instruction-sets (FLIPBIT, SUBLEQ, P1eq), or a simple 7 instruction coding language (LBL, SET, ADD, SUB, JEZ, JMP JLZ).
